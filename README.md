## Homage to Joseph Albers - Relativity of Color

I wanted to create an interactive sketch based on some works by Joseph Albers' Interaction of Color (ISBN: 978-0-300-17935-4).
The Relativity of color sketch works on the premise that one single color can appear as two.

The light brown squares can be clicked and dragged to show that they are the same colour, highlighting that "1 color can be made to appear as 2 different colors".
